		        	<b>SINGAPORE – 17 March 2016</b> – Random Blends, the flagship student showcase from the
				Department of Communications and New Media (CNM) at the Faculty of Arts and Social
				Sciences, National University of Singapore (NUS) returns in 2016 with bold, fresh and
				interactive artworks. Running from 24 to 27 March 2016 at the iconic ArtScience Museum at
				Marina Bay Sands, the showcase which consists of 82 artworks by students, is also part of the
				museum’s Sunday showcase. The opening ceremony on 24 March 2016 will host local-born
				internationally acclaimed artist Mr. Cheo Chai Hiang as Guest of Honour and Mr. Jeffrey Seah,
				Chief Executive Officer, Starcom MediaVest, SEA and VivaKi Country Chairman as Special
				Guest Speaker.
			</br>
			</br>
				Since 2008, Random Blends has brought much vibrancy to the art and design community in
				Singapore, and has also improved the accessibility of art showcase to the public. Beyond its
				role as a nurturing ground for graduating CNM students to showcase their talents, the showcase
				is also a platform for the students to hone their skills in communications and events
				management, or showcase curation, where they serve as organising members of the showcase.
				Training and development are fundamentals of being part of the organising team, encouraging
				the development of art and design appreciation to complement the academic experience at the
				University.
			</br>
			</br>
				This edition of Random Blends celebrates the fluidity of processes, by evoking collective
				thoughts, feelings and hopes for the media, art and communication spheres in a way that is
				sustainable to Singapore through its artworks. Centred on the theme of <i>Construct-Destruct-
				Reconstruct</i>, the showcase aims to challenge audience’s perception of reality and relationships
				in the today’s technologically-driven society.
			</br>
			</br>
				Professor Mohan Dutta, Head, CNM, said, “Random Blends 2016 seeks to be an active witness
				to the Singaporean imagination, depicting the contested, contingent and fragmented spaces of
				participation and citizenship. Both destruction and construction work in mutually constitutive
				ways. By showcasing student works that reflect on the Singapore Spirit, we aim to inspire
				exhibition-goers to contemplate our shared local values, the departures and fragments in these
				values, as well as co-construct creative possibilities through our exhibits’ meaning-making
				opportunities.”
			</br>
			</br>	
				<b>Random Blends 2016 Highlights</b>
				The showcase will feature interactive games and comics, films and photograph series,
				infographics and application mock-ups by students from NUS Department of Communications
				and New Media. This year, the students attempt to tackle the question of how we can
				authentically and meaningfully conceive, understand and influence the media, art and
				communication spheres in a way that not only meet the needs of the society, but is also
				sustainable to Singapore in the long run. Their diverse works reflect an amalgamation of the
				various social and individual identities present in society and its projections of the multitude
				of realities that could possibly happen, to create a more progressive society to live in.
			</br>
			</br>
				Such elements are reflected in works such as Hafiiz K’s <i>Love is What You Want</i>, which explores
				a man’s desire for love through a confessional web comic filled with metaphorical images and
				poetic texts. With the intention of sharing his personal struggles with youths who are trying to
				establish their self-identities, <i>Love is What You Want</i> is a reflection of the artist’s emotions as
				he attempts to construct his personal identity.
			</br>
			</br>
				<i>Desparity</i> by Chng Xinni, Khoo Jun Yang Rossen, Kway Li Ting, Lim Ying Hao Vincent, Tan
				Siew Yan Bettina, is an interactive resource management game which highlights the wide
				disparity within a meritocratic system. The game requires players to study and work hard to
				beat Richard, a student hailing from a higher social class. Through this interactive game play,
				the students hope that players will realise that while meritocracy can be highly effective in a
				utopic society like Singapore, it has ignored the structural inequalities that are present in the
				society.
			</br>
			</br>
				The public can also look forward to engage and interact with the student creators at the
				showcase to find out more about the various artworks.
			</br>
			</br>
				<b>Showcase Details</b></br>
				Random Blends 2016: Construct-Destruct-Reconstruct will be open to the public from 24 - 27

		        <b>SINGAPORE – 17 March 2016</b> – Amidst the fast paced and ever-progressing society, let’s
				take a step back and rethink the meanings of our realities. Themed “Construct-Destruct-
				Reconstruct”, Random Blends 2016 celebrates the fluidity of processes, by evoking collective
				thoughts, feelings and hopes for the media, art and communication spheres in a way that is
				sustainable to Singapore through its artworks.
			</br>
			</br>
				Here’s our pick of five things we loved at this edition of the Random Blends 2016:
			</br>
			</br>
				<b>Love is what you want</b>
			</br>
				One selected work, titled “Love is what you want” by Hafiiz K, a budding local artist, is a
				confessional interactive comic about a man who desires to be loved. The panels are arranged
				such that the reader can feel the emotional regression of the protagonist as emphasized by the
				ladder and the text that stretches down to the bottom of the page. The story then continues
				horizontally until the end to represent the start of a new story for the protagonist. The artwork
				invokes inner thoughts and feelings – love knows no boundaries. At some point of time in life,
				we all yearn to be loved. With whom do you share your innermost feelings? Hafiiz, who is
				pursuing a degree in Communications and New Media, creates his artworks with watercolour,
				drawings and monotypes but constantly experiments with other mediums to explore the
				universal theme of emotions.

				<b>Free admission</b>
			</br>
				Enjoy free admission for all visitors when you visit Random Blends 2016 at world renowned
				ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands. Experience this year’s showcase with artworks such
				as interactive games, application prototypes and digital comics; thought-provoking
				infographics, films and photograph series.
			</br>
			</br>
				<b>Despairity</b></br>
				With the theme of ‘Apart’, Despairity aims to highlight the wide disparity between social
				classes within a meritocratic system. An insightful resource management game, Despairity
				requires players to study and work to beat Richard, a student hailing from a higher social class
				with more wealth and social capital than the player could ever have. Be it earning gold or
				hitting the books, try your very best to exceed Richard’s accomplishments. Discover the
				realities behind the idea of meritocracy that is inherent in Singapore today.

				<b>Zi Heng</b></br>
				This former competitive school team swimmer is a prospective teacher who is a recipient of
				the MOE teaching award, Wong Zi Heng was an active university student until a sudden
				accident at a school orientation camp left him paralysed from chest down. This gripping
				documentary shows being confined to a wheelchair doesn't mean that all hope is lost. Watch
				how Zi Heng copes with his journey to recovery and beyond as he overcomes the limitations
				of his injury.

			</br>
			</br>
				<b>Frozen</b></br>
				Remember the big-screen Disney icy fairy tale that got us all singing along to “Let It Go” ?
				Frozen is a fully interactive comic that allows the reader to dive into the story in more ways
				than one. If flipping through your favourite comic books is magical for you, this interactive
				comic takes it one step further by allowing you to fully immerse yourself in the storyline
				complete with beautiful drawings and sound effects. Take charge of your stories by deciding
				the destiny of your characters in this interactive comic designed by students. In your fairytale,
				Anna may not want to build a snowman with Elsa after all.
