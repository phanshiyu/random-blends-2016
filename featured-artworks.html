While these activities are ordinary, their transiency makes them unique, thus allowing them to embody different significance to every audience. As our nation’s landscape continues to evolve in the years to come, this cinemagraph reminds us to appreciate the precious moments in life – perhaps when we pause to look around us, we could easily find joy in the littlest things that we never knew about before.

		        	Lethargy is a two-part cinemagraph featuring the lives of foreigners who constitute a growing minority in our country. One captures a row of exhausted foreign workers after work while the other features a foreigner in deep sleep with his son. <br><br>

					The aim is to create awareness and appreciation to this group of people who often feel hostility from local Singaporeans by capturing exhaustion into relatable moments. The contrast between the static monochrome foreground with the coloured and flashy background illuminates the mundanity of life against the fleeting moment of time in Singapore’s fast-paced city life.

		        	Inspired by the ground-breaking 2013 Disney film Frozen, this webcomic presents a multipath narrative that progresses to a plot twist with 12 possible kinds of endings. It is designed to be read by two people simultaneously, each of whom is granted the agency to influence one another’s story journeys and outcomes. The social comic aims to bring audiences together and break out from a single-person interactive dimension, such that the combination of choices made at every decision stage will dictate the possible paths that lie ahead for both readers as the story progresses

					A Gallup poll in 2012 has ranked Singapore as the world’s least emotional country. Are Singaporeans really stoics who suffer from an emotional deficit? Or is the poll merely reflective of a cultural anomaly? Through this infographic, visitors are invited to take a personal stance on this issue.

					The comic uses metaphorical images which are made cohesive by the text. It utilizes aspect-to-aspect and action-to-action transitions to depict the protagonist’s contemplations and eventual salvation. The panels in this comic have invisible borders to ensure the fluidity of the narrative and are arranged to depict the emotional regression of the protagonist, as emphasized by the descending ladder and text.

Despairity is a resource management game designed to invoke realization among players that meritocracy, while theoretically highly effective in a utopic society, ignores structural inequalities inherent in Singapore today. Conceptualized around the idea of ‘Apart’ (2 or more entities separated by a specific distance in time or space), the game requires players to study and work to beat Richard, a student from a high social class with more wealth and social capital than the player could ever have, by furiously clicking to earn money or to achieve good grades.
